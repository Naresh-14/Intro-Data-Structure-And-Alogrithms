Problem Statement
You have been provided with an array, 'arr,' consisting of ‘n’ non-negative integers. Your objective is to partition this array into two subsets in a manner that minimizes the absolute difference between the sums of the subsets. 

Your task is to identify the minimum absolute difference by considering various valid partitions of the array elements.

Note
A subset in an array is a group of elements that you pick out, and they can either stay in the same order as the original array or be rearranged.
Note:

Focus solely on determining the minimum absolute difference, taking into account any valid partition of the array elements.

The subsets may not necessarily be contiguous.

The subset sum refers to the sum of all elements within that particular subset.

Example 1:

Input:
4
80 20 70 10

Output:
0

Explanation: The array can be partitioned into {20,70} and {10,80}.

Example 2:

Input:
3
5 3 4

Output:
2

Explanation: The array can be partitioned into {5} and {3,4}.

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 100

0 <= arr[i] <= 1000

0 <= sum(arr) <= 100000
