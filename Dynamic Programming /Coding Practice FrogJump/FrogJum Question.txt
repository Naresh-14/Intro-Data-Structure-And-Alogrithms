Problem Statement
A Frog is situated on the first step of an N-stairs-long staircase. The Frog aspires to reach the Nth stair. Also, the height of the ith stair is represented by height[i-1]. The energy lost during a jump from the ith to the jth stair is determined by the absolute value of the difference between the height[i-1] and the height[j-1].

When Frog is on the ith stair, it has the option to jump either to the i+1th stair or the i+2th stair. Your objective is to determine the minimum total energy expended by the Frog to traverse from the 1st stair to the Nth stair.

Example 1:

Input:
4
80 90 120 100

Output: 20

Explanation:

If the given ‘height’ array is [80, 90, 120, 100], the answer is 20 as Frog can jump from the 1st stair to the 2nd stair (|80-90| = 10 energy lost) and then a jump from the 2nd to the last stair(|100-90| = 10 energy lost). Total energy lost = 10 + 10 = 20.

Example 2:

Input:
6
50 30 80 30 80 70

Output: 40

Explanation:

If the given ‘height’ array is [50, 30, 80, 30, 80, 70], the answer is 40 as Frog can jump from 1st stair to 3rd stair (|50-80| = 30 energy lost) and then a jump from the 3rd stair to the 5th stair (|80-80| = 0 energy lost). Then a jump from the 5th to the 6th stair(|80-70| = 10 energy lost). Total energy lost = 30 + 0 + 10 = 40.

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^5

1 <= height[i] <= 10^3
