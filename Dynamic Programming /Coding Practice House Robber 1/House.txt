Problem Statement:
Imagine you're a thief trying to steal money from houses on a street.

Each house has some cash, but here's the catch: if you rob two houses next to each other, an alarm goes off and the police get called.

You have an array 'arr' showing how much money is in each house. Your goal is to figure out the best way to rob houses without setting off alarms.

Find the most money you can grab without hitting two houses in a row that are next to each other.

Example 1:
Input:
4
30 40 10 50

Output:
90

Explanation: Steal from house number 2, then proceed to house number 4. The total amount you can steal without triggering the alarm is 40 + 50 = 90.

Example 2:

Input:
6
20 70 90 30 10 50


Output:
160
