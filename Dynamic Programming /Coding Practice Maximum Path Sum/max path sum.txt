Problem Statement
Given an M*N grid containing integer values, determine the maximum sum achievable by following a path starting from any cell in the first row and ending at any cell in the last row. 

The allowed movements include moving directly downward, diagonally downward to the left, or diagonally downward to the right.

Specifically, from a cell located at coordinates (i, j), the three possible directions are as follows:

Move down to the cell at coordinates (i+1, j).

Move diagonally down to the left of the cell at coordinates (i+1, j-1).

Move diagonally down to the right of the cell at coordinates (i+1, j+1).

Example 1:

Input:
3 3
10 40 50
30 30 20
30 20 20

Output:
110

Explanation: 
Given a 3 x 3 grid, the maximum path sum is 50 -> 30 -> 30. So, the sum will be 50 + 30 + 30 = 110

Example 2:

Input:
2 2
40 60
30 40

Output:
100

Explanation: 
Given a 2 x 2 grid, the maximum path sum is 60 -> 40. So, the sum will be 60 + 40 = 100.

Constraints:

1 <= N <= 50

1 <= M <= 50

-10^5 <= grid[i][j] <= 10^5
