Partition Equal Subset Sum
Problem Statement :-

Given an array of ‘N’ positive integers ‘arr’, your goal is to determine whether it is possible to divide the array into two subsets in a way that the sum of elements in each subset is equal.

Example 1 :

Input:
5
1 1 3 4 7

Output:
1

Explanation:  The array can be divided into 2 subsets such as [1, 3, 4] and [1, 7]. The sum of each subset is 8.

Example 2 :

Input:
4
2 3 4 6

Output:
0

Explanation:  The array can’t be partitioned into two subsets with equal sum.
