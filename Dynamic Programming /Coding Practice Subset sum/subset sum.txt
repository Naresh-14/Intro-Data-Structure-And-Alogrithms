Subset Sum
Problem Statement :-

Given an array ‘arr’ containing 'N' positive integers and an integer ‘k' your objective is to determine whether there exists a subset in the array whose sum is equal to ‘k.' 

If such a subset is found, return true; otherwise, return false.

Note
A subset in an array is a group of elements that you pick out, and they can either stay in the same order as the original array or be rearranged.
Example 1:

Input:  
4 7
4 5 2 2

Output:
1

Explanation:  For the subset {5, 2}, the sum is 7, which is equal to k

Example 2:

Input: 
5 20
7 2 5 4 3

Output: 
0

Explanation:  In the provided array elements, there are no subsets whose sum equals 20.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^5
0 <= arr[i] <= 10^5
0 <= k <= 10^3
