Introduction
Drawbacks of Arrays

Fixed Size: 

Arrays in most programming languages have a fixed size.

Once you define the size of an array, it cannot be changed dynamically.

This can lead to inefficiencies when the size of the data set is not known in advance or when it changes frequently.


Contiguous Memory Requirement:

Arrays require contiguous memory allocation.

If a large enough block of memory is not available, it may not be possible to create an array of the required size.

Linked List
Node

A node is a basic unit that holds data and may contain a reference or link to another node.

Nodes play a crucial role in forming various data structures, and one such structure is the linked list.

Linked list intro

What is a linked list?

A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of nodes, where each node contains a data element and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.
Head

It is the starting point for traversing the entire list, providing easy access to the initial node.
Tail

It is the last node in a linked list, signaling the end. It efficiently facilitates appending new nodes to the list.

Practical Examples
Music Playlist

To implement the music playlist, we will use a linked list, where each node represents a song and contains information about the song's title, artist, and a reference to the next song in the playlist.

The head of the linked list will represent the first song to play, and the tail will point to the last song in the playlist
